# Authoring workspace snapshot source handoff

This source capability implements #2302–#2305 domain code under #1856. It is not
terminal #2306 acceptance. The integration owner retains shared wire/DI/endpoint/
migration registration, article/session/router/group owners and the live shell.

`AuthoringWorkspaceSnapshotContract` owns the closed reference-only schema:
`default`, authenticated user/site scope, 100 tabs, two groups, 64 KiB, and
integer splitter permille from 200 to 800. Snapshot numbers stay within JavaScript
safe integers. A shared fixture verifies C#/TypeScript canonical digest parity.
Inspector views follow the existing inspector registry, including `rights`.

`AuthoringWorkspaceSnapshotStore` reads without writes and requires expected
revision CAS for create, update and confirmed layout reset. Its PostgreSQL adapter
atomically inserts on conflict or updates the expected revision; it retains one
bounded row per user/site/default, without a receipt history or mutation queue.
`SchemaSql` is an integration offer, never request-time schema provisioning.
Keep the revisioned row across reset to prevent missing-state ABA. Incompatible
or corrupt rows remain blocked; no automatic repair or content deletion occurs.

Bind `AuthoringWorkspaceSnapshotApi` to authenticated typed AEDS v2 using the
existing session, PoW, response/error and privacy protections. Session-derived
scope must reach the server service; client scope is not authentication. No JSON,
local or unavailable-server transport implementation is supplied here.

The single IndexedDB store retains at most eight 80 KiB entries, with a 24-hour
expiry. Entries contain only last verified server snapshots. Cache reads produce
`cached-placeholder`, never a final restore authority. Server observations and
prepared plans have process-local provenance and are invalidated by newer server
responses, offline/scope cleanup and reset. Local mutations stay in current-session
memory. Reconnect reads before a write; changed server revision requires an
explicit server choice. BroadcastChannel carries only scoped revision/lease
invalidation. Web Locks coordinate same-browser flushes; server CAS still arbitrates
all tabs/devices. Input, caret and scroll cause zero snapshot writes.

Restore planning uses one bounded current permission/lifecycle/draft batch. It
removes invalid refs deterministically and exposes reason counts without titles
or fresh denied identities. Execution requires the original qualified FsusUI
factory, official group/shell adapters and a current operation-epoch guard.
The guard must change on user operations, router reset, logout and site switch.
Execution rejects an already started registry, rechecks batch facts, checks
registry revisions and session bindings, and uses the checked activate command.
It never copies editor state or rolls back by deleting a risky session.

Legacy inventory finds one layout key, `fsusblog.article-outline.rail-open.v1`.
It has no user/site/source proof, so migration discards its value. Only explicit
missing-server bootstrap can write default layout via CAS; current server state
wins and successful migration cleans only that key. No draft/comment/journal
keys are read or removed. The existing outline component still owns the old
reader/writer; its removal and shell command binding require the original owner.
`authoringWorkspaceSnapshotStatusModel` and `AuthoringWorkspaceSnapshotResetController`
offer quiet machine-backed status and confirmation logic; live rendering,
keyboard/focus/mobile/a11y qualification remain open.

Focused checks use the ordinary Vitest configuration and backend xUnit project:

```sh
cd src/frontend
node_modules/.bin/vitest run ../../tests/frontend/unit/authoring/authoringWorkspaceSnapshot.test.ts --maxWorkers=1
cd ../..
FSUS_SCHEMA_MIGRATION_POSTGRES_IMAGE=postgres:17-alpine dotnet test tests/backend/FsusBlog.Server.Tests.csproj --no-restore --filter FullyQualifiedName~AuthoringWorkspaceSnapshot
```

PostgreSQL tests use isolated fixture-owned databases/containers and two independent
connections. Transport fixtures and synthetic router interleavings are unit
controls, not authenticated HTTP, production FsusUI or terminal acceptance evidence.
Actual wire/session/PoW, registered migration/DI, real permission batch, official
two-group ownership/collapse, rendered UX, browser restart/multi-device end-to-end,
mutation governance and performance qualification must be completed before issue
closure. Existing registry/session type errors and title-field governance failure
remain original-owner dependencies; no failed gate is waived.
